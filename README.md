# Carbon

### Dev Builds

Carbon is currently in early development and as such, developer / preview builds are not offered.

### Support

Support is given through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Hexaoxide/Carbon/issues)
and [Discord](https://discord.gg/S8s75Yf).  
Please use the discord for help setting up the plugin, and use issues for bug reports.

### Checkstyle

Carbon uses (a fork of) checkstyle to ensure code style is consistent across the entire project.  
For checkstyle support in IDEA:

1) Install the checkstyle plugin (https://github.com/jshiell/checkstyle-idea)
2) Compile https://gitlab.com/stellardrift/stylecheck
3) `Settings` -> `Tools` -> `Checkstyle` `Third-Party Checks`, add the compiled stylecheck jar
4) While still in the `Checkstyle` tab, go to `Configuration File`, add `.checkstyle/checkstyle.xml` and tick the check
   box.
